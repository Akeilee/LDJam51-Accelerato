'Rat1_Grind_Right_Frame1' is the same as the 'Rat1_Jump_Right_Frame4' PNG in the Jump Right folder.
I wasn't sure if you needed it to be part of the grind animation.
If they're not needed 'Rat1_Grind_Right_Frame2', 'Rat1_Grind_Right_Frame3' & 'Rat1_Grind_Right_Frame4' can be looped for as long as the rail lasts.
